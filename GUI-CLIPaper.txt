Both the Graphical User Interface (GUI), and Command Line Interface (CLI) are integral for a user to efficiently use and navigate a computer system. 
Both interfaces give users access to the devices directory to access and navigate around different files within the system.
While both complete essentially the same function, they each fit with different uses and scenarios.
The GUI is the typical interface that most users will only ever see nowadays. 
It presents information in a way that makes the most sense to human eyes, using colors and patterns to easily communicate relationships.
There are many different options for GUIs, from many different providers such as Windows, Mac, and Linux distros.
However, using a GUI can be an inefficient use of resources, depending on the purpose of that device.
This is where CLIs can be useful. They allow users who know how to correctly communicate to the computer to navigate through text-only commands.
Mostly any function that can be performed in a GUI can also be performed in a CLI if the user knows the command.
There are a couple different CLIs to interact with the different systems. 
Windows has Powershell, Linux has the Terminal app, and I don't know what Mac uses because it I don't like apple.
