Last Lecture Takeaways
I really enjoyed the Last Lecture. 
Randy Pausch really killed it in his delivery, I forgot after the first 5 minutes that I was actually watching a lecture for class, his stories were so entertaining! 
Throughout the lecture, he reinforced the themes of perseverance, making your goals and finding ways to achieve them, and being understanding with people. 
One of the stories that stuck with me the most was about how the different deans responded to his request to join the Imagineers. 
They essentially were saying the same thing, yet just the way they first responded to him steered the respective conversations in completely different directions. 
If I were to summarize the moral of this story, it would be to “Think before you respond”. 
I think this is a piece of advice that I can carry forward in my life and will benefit me in both my personal and professional careers. 
I absolutely loved his positivity throughout the lecture, even though he was in dire circumstances regarding his long-term health. 
It was inspiring to see his optimism in the face of death, and to see how enthusiastic he was to ensure that his work could continue after his life. 
My absolute favorite anecdote that he made was the Winnie the Pooh reference. 
If you are familiar with the show, a person should ask themselves if they want to be a Tigger or an Eyore. 
This is a great contrast of the two childhood characters to really inspire someone to be enthusiastic and optimistic.
