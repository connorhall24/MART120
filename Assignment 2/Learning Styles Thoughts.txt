Learning Styles Thoughts
I think learning styles absolutely affect how someone learns, but I think the impact is seen more in home study rather than in the classroom. In the classroom, the student doesn’t get to decide what the teaching method is, so that forces students to adhere to their teachers individual method. In my particular case, I test as auditory being my learning style by 60%. This does not work for me, because I am basically deaf in one ear. I have to adapt my learning style to mostly be from visual learning, which can be difficult at times. However, learning how to learn from other styles is useful for those situations where you don’t get to choose how you’re taught. My results from the survey are below:
What's Your Learning Style? The Results
Connor's scores:
* Auditory: 60%
* Visual: 10%
* Tactile: 30%
You are an Auditory learner! Check out the information below, or view all of the learning styles.
Auditory
If you are an auditory learner, you learn by hearing and listening. You understand and remember things you have heard. You store information by the way it sounds, and you have an easier time understanding spoken instructions than written ones. You often learn by reading out loud because you have to hear it or speak it in order to know it.
As an auditory learner, you probably hum or talk to yourself or others if you become bored. People may think you are not paying attention, even though you may be hearing and understanding everything being said.
Here are some things that auditory learners like you can do to learn better.
* Sit where you can hear.
* Have your hearing checked on a regular basis.
* Use flashcards to learn new words; read them out loud.
* Read stories, assignments, or directions out loud.
* Record yourself spelling words and then listen to the recording.
* Have test questions read to you out loud.
* Study new material by reading it out loud.
Remember that you need to hear things, not just see things, in order to learn well.
